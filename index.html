        <strong>&ldquo;</strong> The end of my pre-service training is coming to an end. I’ve been in Africa for almost two months now. I’m constantly shifting up and down in a perpetual roller coaster of emotions. One day I will be so homesick and ready to abandon my service to be with my boyfriend and family again. Then the next day I go somewhere new or meet a new friend and see so many opportunities, determined to continue this journey. I write in my journal to keep track my feelings. It helps to list the pros and cons of my experience. Lately, I’ve felt incompetent in learning the languages here. I feel like I am the slowest one in my language group. During my last one-on-one evaluation, I started crying. I get so frustrated because I barely understand what is being said to me. No matter how much study, I still only know a few phrases and some vocabulary. However, I’ve realized I’m a slow learner in general. I like taking my time to understand things at my own pace. I know the language will come eventually. <strong>&rdquo;</strong>

        <strong>&ldquo;</strong> Our LCF party was a lot of fun!  We surprised our LCFs at school with a cake and presents.  We even ordered the cake to say thank you in Mongolian.  Our LCFs responded by having our host siblings throw a surprise goodbye party for us.  The food at the surprise party really showed their understanding of Americans- there was French toast, jims (fruit), and a cake made entirely of vegetables complete with mayonnaise frosting.  They must think we are very strange haha (they did not eat any of the food they made for us).  They also then made us play a variety of “party games” that they insist all Mongolians play.  We played a very competitive round of musical chairs, in which the person who loses each round gets his or her face painted by his or her sibling… some siblings were kind, others were not J <strong>&rdquo;</strong>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
