    &ldquo; Yesterday I returned after visiting my new village, Arangallen. I met my supervisor, Mr. Sutay Bah. He is the headmaster (principal) at the school I will work at. I love my new village! It is super small and quiet. The land is beautiful and lush. Green fields and crops surround our compound. My house is spacious and I see so much potential for decorating it. I also have a lime tree in my backyard! This will be my permanent site where I will live for two years. My family is nice too. My new surname will be Mendy. I will learn the Jola, Mandinka and Manjaco languages. We have a dog, two kitties and several chickens with baby chicks. My house is right off the main road so traveling will be easy. I do not have electricity and the nearest water pump is across the road about 100 meters away. But one of the teachers who lives in my compound said he can help me install a solar panel, outlet and lighting. My school is less than a 5 minute walk away. We only have two small shops so I will have to travel to the village of Sibanor to go to the market. It is about a 15 minute bike ride and the site of a fellow volunteer. There is another volunteer in the village of Bwiam about a 30 minute bike ride in the opposite direction. I also met the arts and crafts teacher, Mr. Silva Mendy. He showed me the school and the art supply room. It is basically a small, dusty room with some leftover art projects. We talked about the school’s need for a separate art studio. It will take much effort, time and money but I think it is a real possibility. I would love to learn more about African pottery and create a ceramics program at the school. Unfortunately Mr. Mendy will be leaving in a few months to attend classes at the university. I am happy for him, but also sad because we just met. Hopefully the school will find a new arts and crafts teacher that is willing to become my counterpart. &rdquo;

    &ldquo; Our last week at Sukhbaatar was a whirlwind of goodbyes and parties.  We threw thank you parties for both our families and our LCFs.  For the family party, we gathered at one pm, with each of us bringing a different food.  Us being the Americans that we are, did not cook any meat, since the majority of us were unsure of how to cook meat without a stove or anything to keep it warm.  So we had fruit salad, vegetable salad, French toast, deviled eggs, and macaroni salad.  Of course, this being Mongolia, we had lots of “juice” on hand (Mongolians use the word juice to describe coke and Fanta products).  We handed out certificates made by Peace Corps and took some pictures.  My host mom was less than pleased that her nap was interrupted (she is now  very pregnant).  But the party was a success because almost all the food was gone- the only thing remaining was the vegetable salad. Typical Mongolia… &rdquo;

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
