                    <strong>&ldquo;</strong> Books - memoirs, novels, what have you - about Africa much more engaging after living in Togo. Now I have a frame of reference, visuals for descriptions of the market or the woman cooking over her stove. This frame of reference also includes a historical-geographical context, especially for West Africa. <strong>&rdquo;</strong>

                    <strong>&ldquo;</strong> The title of this blog entry is in reference to a proverb. It was given to me as part of an ice-breaker activity. I had the first part, “Don’t cross the bridge,” and my supervisor had the remaining piece, “until you come to it.” It has also become a mantra to guide me throughout my service. Every day and every night I miss Lorenzo. Missing him feels like a thousand years with the sun. I call him my sun, “el sol de mi vida”. Before I met him, I was depressed for several years. Heartbroken, lost and stressed out from my previous job. He healed my heart and has been supportive this entire time. As much as I want to go back to him, I know I must not give up. I should not make any drastic decisions based on my emotions. Instead, I will wait until I’ve arrived at a stable frame of mind before crossing over into the next stage of my life. <strong>&rdquo;</strong>

All afternoon we had been hearing rumors that someone else had raised $1,300, which sent us into a panic. Things weren’t looking good for the San Nicoals team, and when my host dad came over and gave me an awkward speech about being ok with losing and saying congratulations to the winner, we figured it was clear that this American was coming in second. The head judge proceeded to call up the top 3, the girls who had raised the most money, and Mario and I went up to the stage. I was ready to come in second, there was no way I was going to win, but then, to all of our surprise, the announced the  <strong>&rdquo;</strong>

                    <strong>&ldquo;</strong> Friday night, we had dinner at a local Mongolian restaurant with all the Americans and our two LCFs.  There were lots of tears and heartfelt speeches- I will truly miss being among my Sukh 2 sitemates.  They have made what would have been an impossibly difficult summer much easier and I don’t think I could have made it through the summer without them! <strong>&rdquo;</strong>
