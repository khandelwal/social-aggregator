        <strong>&ldquo;</strong> Last week we took a field trip to Janjangbureh. It was refreshing to be away from the training village. We went to visit the Armitage school and the Governor’s house. He was very welcoming and invited us into his office. It was pristine and official looking with clean, white tiled floors. He thanked us for coming to the Gambia and wished us a safe and successful stay. After, we took a boat ride across the River Gambia to the Janjangbureh camp. We were greeted by the staff and groups of monkeys! Entering the camp felt like a mini jungle, surrounded by trees and huts with thatched roofs. Our lodging was nice. We had comfortable beds with mosquito nets, a toilet, even a shower! It was an upgrade than the house I am currently living in, but still nothing close to a hotel in the U.S. Later we went swimming in the river and jumped off the boat into the water. We were having fun and I genuinely felt like I was on vacation. But then we saw hippos off in the distance! I was amazing but also terrifying because hippos are very dangerous. So we quickly got out of the water. Later that evening we had dinner and were entertained by a traditional African drumming performance. There was singing, dancing and lots of laughter. Over all, this field trip helped me appreciate being in the Gambia. I realized I need more exciting adventures like this to keep me motivated. <strong>&rdquo;</strong>

        <strong>&ldquo;</strong> Our last week at Sukhbaatar was a whirlwind of goodbyes and parties.  We threw thank you parties for both our families and our LCFs.  For the family party, we gathered at one pm, with each of us bringing a different food.  Us being the Americans that we are, did not cook any meat, since the majority of us were unsure of how to cook meat without a stove or anything to keep it warm.  So we had fruit salad, vegetable salad, French toast, deviled eggs, and macaroni salad.  Of course, this being Mongolia, we had lots of “juice” on hand (Mongolians use the word juice to describe coke and Fanta products).  We handed out certificates made by Peace Corps and took some pictures.  My host mom was less than pleased that her nap was interrupted (she is now  very pregnant).  But the party was a success because almost all the food was gone- the only thing remaining was the vegetable salad. Typical Mongolia… <strong>&rdquo;</strong>

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
