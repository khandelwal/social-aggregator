                <strong>&ldquo;</strong> Books - memoirs, novels, what have you - about Africa much more engaging after living in Togo. Now I have a frame of reference, visuals for descriptions of the market or the woman cooking over her stove. This frame of reference also includes a historical-geographical context, especially for West Africa. <strong>&rdquo;</strong>

                <strong>&ldquo;</strong> Tuesday-Friday: spent a lot of time in my hotel room, but also made it out for mini adventures as I felt I could. There’s another  PCV here from Micronesia and we got together for dinner multiple nights.  <strong>&rdquo;</strong>

                <strong>&ldquo;</strong> Yesterday I returned after visiting my new village, Arangallen. I met my supervisor, Mr. Sutay Bah. He is the headmaster (principal) at the school I will work at. I love my new village! It is super small and quiet. The land is beautiful and lush. Green fields and crops surround our compound. My house is spacious and I see so much potential for decorating it. I also have a lime tree in my backyard! This will be my permanent site where I will live for two years. My family is nice too. My new surname will be Mendy. I will learn the Jola, Mandinka and Manjaco languages. We have a dog, two kitties and several chickens with baby chicks. My house is right off the main road so traveling will be easy. I do not have electricity and the nearest water pump is across the road about 100 meters away. But one of the teachers who lives in my compound said he can help me install a solar panel, outlet and lighting. My school is less than a 5 minute walk away. We only have two small shops so I will have to travel to the village of Sibanor to go to the market. It is about a 15 minute bike ride and the site of a fellow volunteer. There is another volunteer in the village of Bwiam about a 30 minute bike ride in the opposite direction. I also met the arts and crafts teacher, Mr. Silva Mendy. He showed me the school and the art supply room. It is basically a small, dusty room with some leftover art projects. We talked about the school’s need for a separate art studio. It will take much effort, time and money but I think it is a real possibility. I would love to learn more about African pottery and create a ceramics program at the school. Unfortunately Mr. Mendy will be leaving in a few months to attend classes at the university. I am happy for him, but also sad because we just met. Hopefully the school will find a new arts and crafts teacher that is willing to become my counterpart. <strong>&rdquo;</strong>

                <strong>&ldquo;</strong> Friday night, we had dinner at a local Mongolian restaurant with all the Americans and our two LCFs.  There were lots of tears and heartfelt speeches- I will truly miss being among my Sukh 2 sitemates.  They have made what would have been an impossibly difficult summer much easier and I don’t think I could have made it through the summer without them! <strong>&rdquo;</strong>
